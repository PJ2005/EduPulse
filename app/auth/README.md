# Authentication Security Measures

The EduPulse authentication system incorporates the following security measures to protect user accounts and data:

## Password Policies

Password policies, such as minimum length and complexity requirements, are enforced by Firebase Authentication for email/password accounts. This ensures that users create strong passwords.

## Rate Limiting

To prevent brute-force attacks on the login endpoint, we implement rate limiting using `fastapi-limiter` and Redis. The configuration is as follows:

*   A Redis instance is used to store login attempt counts.
*   The `/api/auth/login` endpoint is limited to N attempts per M minutes (replace N and M with your chosen values).
*   After exceeding the limit, further login attempts from the same source (e.g., IP address) are blocked for a certain period.

(You should also include an example of how the rate limiting is applied to the login endpoint using the `@limiter.limit()` decorator, but I cannot provide this code here due to the file modification limitations.)

## CSRF Protection

Since the authentication system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication, CSRF protection is less critical. The JWT itself acts as a CSRF token because it is specific to the user and origin. However, in scenarios where cookie-based authentication is used, CSRF protection would be essential.

## Input Validation

Input validation is performed using Pydantic models for all API endpoints that accept user input. These models define the expected data types and schemas, ensuring that incoming data is valid and preventing unexpected errors or security vulnerabilities caused by malformed input.

## Data Sanitization

To mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, it is recommended to sanitize any user-provided HTML content before rendering it. This can be achieved using a library like `bleach`, which removes or escapes potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
